# curriculum-vitae

This repository contains the curriculum vitae (CV) of me, [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham). This repository uses
[gkapfham/research-bibliography](https://github.com/gkapfham/research-bibliography) as a Git submodule to create several
pages of the document in an automated fashion. Parts of this CV are inspired by the example provided at
[moutonf/CV](https://github.com/moutonf/CV), which uses revised versions of the
[moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) and [moderntimeline](https://github.com/raphink/moderntimeline) packages.
As this document is my own customized professional statement, I ask that, if you use it as inspiration or for reference,
you suitably customize it for your own purposes.
