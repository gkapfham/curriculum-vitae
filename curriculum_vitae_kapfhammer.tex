\section{Research Interests}

{\small As an experimental computer scientist, the goal of my research is to design, implement, and evaluate
  techniques and software tools that support the creation of high-quality software.  This research addresses the
challenges within the fields of software engineering, software testing and analysis, and computer systems.}
\vspace*{.05in}

{\small My research is empirical in nature because it involves the application of the scientific method to formulate
  problem statements, conduct experiments, take observations, perform detailed statistical analyses on the collected
  data, and draw conclusions based on the results.  My research focuses on the design, implementation, description, and
  release of both computational artifacts and data sets suitable for use by undergraduate and graduate students,
software engineering practitioners, and other computer scientists in both academia and industry.}
\vspace*{.05in}

{\small I conduct this research in collaboration with undergraduate students at Allegheny College, graduate students
  and professors at other colleges and universities, and colleagues in industry. To date, my research has lead to
  forty-seven publications, thirty invited presentations, four edited volumes, and the supervision of fifty-seven
students.}
