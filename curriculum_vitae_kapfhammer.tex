\section{Research Overview}

% Summary of research

{\small
%
  As an experimental computer scientist, the goal of my research is to design,
  implement, and evaluate approaches and software tools that support the
  creation of high-quality software. This research addresses the challenges
  within the fields of software engineering, software testing, program analysis,
  and computer systems. My research is empirical in nature because it involves
  the application of the scientific method to formulate problem statements,
  conduct experiments, take observations, perform detailed statistical analyses
  on the collected data, and draw conclusions based on the results. My research
  focuses on the design, implementation, description, and release of both
  computational artifacts and data sets suitable for use by undergraduate and
  graduate students, software engineering practitioners, and other computer
  scientists in both academia and industry.
%
}

\vspace*{.1in}

% Summary of research service and collaboration

{\small
  %
  I am an associate editor for the {\em Journal of Software: Evolution and
  Process}, an academic editor for {\em PeerJ Computer Science}, a program
  committee member for conferences like the International Conference on
  Software Testing, Verification and Validation and the International
  Conference on Automated Software Engineering, and a reviewer for journals
  such as {\em Transactions on Software Engineering} and {\em Information and
  Software Technology}. Along with contributing to open-source software, I
  collaborate with researchers and engineers at leading academic institutions,
  government agencies, and \mbox{technology companies}. My research is funded
  by grants from the Office of the Provost at Allegheny College, the Mozilla
  Foundation, and Facebook Research.
